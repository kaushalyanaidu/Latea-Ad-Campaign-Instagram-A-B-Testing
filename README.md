##Latea Ad Campaign – Instagram A/B Testing Strategy
Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a marketing strategy initiative in collaboration with Latea Bubble Tea, a local tea chain. The primary goal was to design and test Instagram ad creatives to boost impressions, understand user engagement, and determine the most effective advertising approach using A/B testing.

Objectives
Launch a digital ad campaign for Latea on Instagram.

Compare the performance of two ad types:

Central-focused ads (highlighting product details).

Peripheral-focused ads (lifestyle, mood-based imagery).

Track impressions and user interaction using analytics.

Deliver actionable insights and future ad strategy recommendations.

Campaign Strategy
Target Platform: Instagram (static photo posts)

Ad Types:

Central Route: Emphasizes product quality, ingredients, and clarity (ideal for detail-oriented audiences).

Peripheral Route: Focuses on emotional appeal, aesthetics, and aspirational lifestyle (ideal for impulse-based engagement).

A/B Testing Setup:

Both ad variants were posted simultaneously.

Performance was tracked over a set campaign period.

Metrics like impressions, likes, comments, and reach were compared.

Success Metrics
Total Impressions per post

Engagement Rate (likes + comments / impressions)

Reach

Follower growth (if available)

User reactions (qualitative if available)

Key Insights
Peripheral images drew higher impressions and engagement, especially among casual viewers.

Central images appealed more to repeat customers and detail-oriented users (based on survey and anecdotal feedback).

A/B testing revealed the importance of tailoring creatives to different goals — awareness vs conversion.

Ad Creatives
Central Image: Featured the Latea drink with brand logo and text on ingredients and benefits.

Peripheral Image: Showed the drink in a cozy, lifestyle-oriented scene with a warm mood and minimal text.

⚠Real photos were used to reflect Latea’s all-natural branding and avoid the artificial look of AI-generated images.
